      <h1>About Us!</h1>
      <p>Braden Bisping's Virutal Band (BBVB) is a band created by Braden Bisping and Vince Battista! BBVB was created
        in September of 2018. We play mostly electronic music; however, we get <a routerLink="/music" routerLinkActive="active">inspiration</a> from many different types of 
        artists! If you want to hear about what's going on in our life, check out our  <a routerLink="/news" routerLinkActive="active">news page</a>! If you'd like to buy
        some of our merch, check out <a routerLink="/merch" routerLinkActive="active">merch page</a>! All the designs that we sell on our merch page were designed by us!
        Our first album is self-titled "Braden Bisping's Virtual Band", our second one is titled "Virtual Boiz", and we have no plans of stopping!
      </p>
    <p>Braden Bisping is the first member of the group and the one after which it was named. He was born on January 7, 1997. He took piano 
      lessons when he was in early grade school, but lost interest in music until he returned back to it over a decade later, and learned to play
      guitar and took back to his roots with the electric keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>Vince Battista is the second member of the group. He was born in Illinois on August 11, 1997. He's always loved music and 
      began playing his first instrument, the alto saxophone, in 4th grade. Afterwards, he's learned bassoon and bariton saxophone. 
      He has many different hobbies besides playing music, reading comics, playing video games, and watching movies are different things
      that he loves to do! In addition to those, he dabbles with photoshop on the side and was the one who created all of our merchandise!
